## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
file_path <- 'C:/Users/jrlang/Desktop/flights.csv'
csv_data <- read_csv(file = file_path)
```
```{r}
big_lebowski <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/?ref_=nv_sr_1")
class(big_lebowski)
```
```{r}
data(iris)
iris <- as.data.frame(iris)
iris <- as.tibble(iris)
```

```{r}
write_delim(csv_data, delim = "|", 'C:/Users/jrlang/Desktop/flights_pipedelim_out.csv')
```

```{r}
write_delim(csv_data, delim = ";", 'C:/Users/jrlang/Desktop/flights_semidelim_out.csv')
```
